# EOF_vertical
Compute vertical Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) from horizontal velocity profiles sampled at non-uniform depth intervals.

# Acknowledgement
This function is inspired by the eof function in Climate Data Toolbox (CDT) developed by Chad A. Greene.
The calculations were conducted with valuable guidance from my advisors, 
Andrew L. Stewart and James C. McWilliams.
